== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My theme/site appears not to like this plugin. It's not displaying correctly. =

* In most cases  the issue is caused by markup errors in the page where the plugin is used. Please fix any errors with your theme.
* The plugin requires Flash Player 9 or better and javascript. Please be sure you've  got both.

= The clock is aligned off-center =

* Try tweaking the width and height parameters.  It's likley the width should be reduced if the clock is to far to the right.

= What is with the question mark =

* There is a very small question mark included in the clock that leads you to the information page for this widget.  This is to spread the word about my widget to other people who be interested in installing it.  You can remove this if you like, but I would really appreciate some other form of attribution (blog post, blogroll link, or whatever)


= How I can change the clock style ? =
